Apache Kafka – 
Kafka is a messaging system used for sending and listening event using a publish subscribe model.
It is highly scalable and reliable. It is used for data or information communication between components of an application or systems
If you want to send some data or message to a component of an application and it should be run time where once you send some message, component should read it automatically without waiting. Kafka is best fit for that.

Terminologies: 
The basic architecture of has below listed components: 
•	Topics – A unique key of communication between producer and consumer
•	Producers – Sends messages to consumer using topic
•	Consumers – Reads messages send by producer using topic on which it is sent.
•	Brokers – Nodes where all the Kafka requests are called.
All messages you send to a component are send using a topic and all messages you read from components are also fetched using a topic.
